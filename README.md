# Draggable Box Extension MVP

This project is a minimal viable product (MVP) built with React that creates a draggable, resizable box extension. The extension allows users to enter text, fetch responses via an API (using a provided API key), and display the response inside a flexible box. Additional features include the ability to copy the box’s content and a fade effect when the user stops hovering over the box.

## Features

- **User Input Interface:**  
  A simple text input area where users can type their query or command.

- **API Integration:**  
  Users can input their API key. The extension will use this key to fetch and display responses accordingly.

- **Flexible, Draggable Box:**  
  The response is displayed in a resizable and draggable box. The layout adjusts based on the content and box size.

- **Hover & Fade Effect:**  
  When the user stops hovering over the box surface, a fade effect is applied to provide a subtle visual cue.

- **Copy-to-Clipboard:**  
  Users can easily copy the content displayed in the box by clicking a copy button.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 12 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/draggable-box-extension.git
   cd draggable-box-extension
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

Your extension should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is already in use).

## Project Structure

```
/src
  ├── components
  │   ├── InputBox.jsx         // User input field and API key handling
  │   ├── ResponseBox.jsx      // Displays API responses; includes drag, resize, and fade effects
  │   └── CopyButton.jsx       // Button to copy content from the response box
  ├── App.jsx                  // Main app component that integrates all parts
  ├── index.js                 // Entry point of the React app
  └── styles.css               // Basic styling for components
```

## Usage

1. **Enter API Key & Query:**  
   Use the provided input fields to enter your API key and query.

2. **View Response:**  
   The API response will appear in the draggable and resizable response box.

3. **Copy Content:**  
   Hover over the response box to reveal the copy button. Click it to copy the content.  
   When you stop hovering, the box will gently fade out for a cleaner look.

## Future Enhancements

- **Error Handling:**  
  Improve error messaging for failed API calls.

- **Advanced Drag & Drop:**  
  Enhance the drag-and-drop functionality for smoother user interaction.

- **Customization Options:**  
  Allow users to change the box’s appearance and behavior via settings.
